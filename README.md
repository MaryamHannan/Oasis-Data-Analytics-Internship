###Task 1 House Price Prediction
by Using ML Models
Description:

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a
numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a
fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in
developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.



Key Concepts and Challenges:

Data Collection: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for
prediction.
Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle
missing values, and ensure data quality.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model.
Model Training: Implement linear regression using a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit-
Learn).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using
metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.
Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and
actual values.


###Task 2  Wine Quality Prediction




Description:
The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a
real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset
encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the
features for three distinct classifier models.



Key Concepts and Challenges:
Classifier Models: Utilizing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support
Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction.
Chemical Qualities: Analyzing features like density and acidity as predictors for wine quality.
Data Analysis Libraries: Employing Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array
operations.
Data Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the
dataset.
